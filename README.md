# temp-repo
This open-source class consists of four steps.
First, create a branch. It is to create a branch with new functions added, not the main.
Second commit a file. It is possible to return to this point if necessary with a kind of snapshot function.
Third, open a pull request. When completed, ask the manager to integrate it.
Finally, merge your pull request. It is the process of integrating the newly created branch with the main.
